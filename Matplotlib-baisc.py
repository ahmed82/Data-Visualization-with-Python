 so you would not have to worry about that. Otherwise, you would need to run the following
 line of code to install the xlrd module:

""" ##################### Visualizing Data using Matplotlib #############################
Matplotlib: Standard Python Visualization Library
The primary plotting library we will explore in the course is Matplotlib. As mentioned on their website:

Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

If you are aspiring to create impactful visualization with python, Matplotlib is an essential tool to have at your disposal.

Matplotlib.Pyplot
One of the core aspects of Matplotlib is matplotlib.pyplot. It is Matplotlib's scripting layer which we studied in details in the videos about Matplotlib. Recall that it is a collection of command style functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. In this lab, we will work with the scripting layer to learn how to generate line plots. In future labs, we will get to work with the Artist layer as well to experiment first hand how it differs from the scripting layer.

Let's start by importing Matplotlib and Matplotlib.pyplot as follows:"""

# we are using the inline backend
%matplotlib inline 

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# *optional: check if Matplotlib is loaded.
print ('Matplotlib version: ', mpl.__version__) # >= 2.0.0

""" ############################## Plotting in pandas ###################
Fortunately, pandas has a built-in implementation of Matplotlib that we can use. 
Plotting in pandas is as simple as appending a .plot() method to a series or dataframe.

Documentation:

Plotting with Series
Plotting with Dataframes
Line Pots (Series/Dataframe) 
What is a line plot and why use it?

A line chart or line plot is a type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. Use line plot when you have a continuous data set. These are best suited for trend-based visualizations of data over a period of time.

Let's start with a case study:

In 2010, Haiti suffered a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake. The quake caused widespread devastation and loss of life and aout three million people were affected by this natural disaster. As part of Canada's humanitarian effort, the Government of Canada stepped up its effort in accepting refugees from Haiti. We can quickly visualize this effort using a Line plot:

Question: Plot a line graph of immigration from Haiti using df.plot().

First, we will extract the data series for Haiti."""

haiti = df_can.loc['Haiti', years] # passing in years 1980 - 2013 to exclude the 'total' column
haiti.head()

# Next, we will plot a line plot by appending `.plot()` to the `haiti` dataframe.
haiti.plot()

"""pandas automatically populated the x-axis with the index values (years), and the y-axis with the column values (population). However, 
notice how the years were not displayed because they are of type string.Therefore, let's change the type of the index values to integer for plotting.

Also, let's label the x and y axis using plt.title(), plt.ylabel(), and plt.xlabel() as follows:"""

haiti.index = haiti.index.map(int) # let's change the index values of Haiti to type integer for plotting
haiti.plot(kind='line')

plt.title('Immigration from Haiti')
plt.ylabel('Number of immigrants')
plt.xlabel('Years')

plt.show() # need this line to show the updates made to the figure

"""We can clearly notice how number of immigrants from Haiti spiked up from 2010 as Canada stepped up its efforts to accept refugees from Haiti. Let's annotate this spike in the plot by using the plt.text() method."""

haiti.plot(kind='line')

plt.title('Immigration from Haiti')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')
plt.xlabel('Years')

# annotate the 2010 Earthquake. 
# syntax: plt.text(x, y, label)
plt.text(2000, 6000, '2010 Earthquake') # see note below

plt.show() 

"""With just a few lines of code, you were able to quickly identify and visualize the spike in immigration!

Quick note on x and y values in plt.text(x, y, label):

 Since the x-axis (years) is type 'integer', we specified x as a year. The y axis (number of immigrants) is type 'integer', so we can just specify the value y = 6000.
    plt.text(2000, 6000, '2010 Earthquake') # years stored as type int
If the years were stored as type 'string', we would need to specify x as the index position of the year. Eg 20th index is year 2000 since it is the 20th year with a base year of 1980.
    plt.text(20, 6000, '2010 Earthquake') # years stored as type int
We will cover advanced annotation methods in later modules.
We can easily add more countries to line plot to make meaningful comparisons immigration from different countries.

Question: Let's compare the number of immigrants from India and China from 1980 to 2013.
"""
# Step 1: Get the data set for China and India, and display dataframe.

# Step 2: Plot graph. We will explicitly specify line plot by passing in kind parameter to plot().        
df_CI.plot(kind='line')

"""That doesn't look right...

Recall that pandas plots the indices on the x-axis and the columns as individual lines on the y-axis. Since df_CI is a dataframe with the country as the index and years as the columns, we must first transpose the dataframe using transpose() method to swap the row and columns.
"""
df_CI = df_CI.transpose()

That's because haiti is a series as opposed to a dataframe, and has the years as its indices as shown below.
"""
print(type(haiti))
print(haiti.head(5))

"""
Line plot is a handy tool to display several dependent variables against one independent variable. However, it is recommended that no more than 5-10 lines on a single graph; any more than that and it becomes difficult to interpret.

Question: Compare the trend of top 5 countries that contributed the most to immigration to Canada."""
# The correct answer is:
# Step 1: Get the dataset. Recall that we created a Total column that calculates the cumulative immigration by country. 
# We will sort on this column to get our top 5 countries using pandas sort_values() method.
